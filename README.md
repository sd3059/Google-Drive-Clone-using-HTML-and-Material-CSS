# Google-Drive-Clone-using-HTML-and-Material-CSS
I have created a mini project using HTML and Material CSS, and my main focus was on creating a Google Drive Clone.
Here I used various HTML tags. All these tags have their own unique functionalities.
In order to make the clone look more specific, good, attractive. 
I also used CSS to include notification icon, other icon, folder icon and so on.
